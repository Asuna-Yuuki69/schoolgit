# My dear friend Thomas

Thomas is one of my very close friends who i know from elementary school. And we know each other very well, he is very reliable and hard working at school. He comes from a decently rich family hence his dad is a chef and his mom has a private geodetic company. He has a brother who is also excellent at school and a cute dog. 

Thomas as a person is very strange at times, especially when he's with his girlfriend, then he can be extremely annoying and corny but when he's not in her immediate proximity he is completely alright and ok to talk to. He is very good at cooking and at learning stuff for school. His job is a bike repair technician and he's liked by his coworkers. I personally have no idea what fun activities to do with him since he does everything like that with his girlfriend instead of the boys.

Overall he is a straight A student and i think he could get along with everyone (except the girls who he's banned from talking to)
